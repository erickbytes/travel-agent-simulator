# travel-agent-simulator
a Python script choice-based game about running a travel agency

This is the initial effort for an idea to make a game mimicing the life of a travel agent whose goal is to gain clients.

Start by running the script: ```python travel_agent_simulator.py```

The game prompts to choose one of the following 8 actions.

1. Run Campaign: run a campaign to gain leads
2. Pitch Client: after gaining a lead, it can be converted into a client by an in-person meeting
3. Message Client: leads can be nurtured with messages
4. Upgrade Office: improvements to the agency office can improve sales output
5. Hire Salesperson: adding more people to sell vacations improves profits
6. Hire Social Media Intern: investing in social media presence improves profits
7. Attend Training: teaching your salespeople the information they need improves their ability and experience
8. Exit: end the game at any time

TODO:

- "Save & Exit" button writes game status to a saved file, which is reloaded the next time the script is run
- integrate pygame / improve graphics
- tweak game economics, payouts and probabilities for more fun experience
